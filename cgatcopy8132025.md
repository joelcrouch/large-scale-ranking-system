  hasn't been run.

  Please run the first code cell in your notebook. It contains the following code:

   1 import pandas as pd
   2 ratings_file ='../../data/processed/amazon_all_beauty/ratings.csv'
   3 df = pd.read_csv(ratings_file)

✦ You are correct, the directory /home/r-dev1/dev/large-scale-ranking-system/data/processed/amazon_all_beauty/

  I will now examine the contents of scripts/amz_data_setup.py to understand how it should have processed the
  data and why it might have failed.
 ╭────────────────────────────────────────╮
 │ ✔  ReadFile scripts/amz_data_setup.py  │
 ╰────────────────────────────────────────╯
✦ After reviewing the amz_data_setup.py script, I've identified the likely cause of the issue.

  You mentioned running the script with the command: scripts/amz_data_setup.py --categoyr All_Beauty

  It appears there is a typo in the argument. It should be --category instead of --categoyr.

  Because of this typo, the script likely used the default category, "Digital_Music", for the download, and
  therefore no data for "All_Beauty" was processed.

  To fix this, you should:

   1. Run the script with the correct command:

   1     python scripts/amz_data_setup.py --category All_Beauty

   2. (Optional but recommended) Clean up the "Digital_Music" data that was likely downloaded by the previous
      command to avoid confusion. I can provide the commands to do that if you'd like.

  After running the correct command, the ratings.csv file should be created in
  data/processed/amazon_all_beauty/, and you'll be able to proceed with your notebook.

✦ Thank you for providing the output. It seems the script ran successfully, downloaded, and processed the
  data. The output confirms that the ratings DataFrame was created with 694,252 rows.

  This contradicts the earlier finding that the processed directory is empty. There might be a discrepancy
  in the path or some other issue.

  Let's re-verify the contents of the processed data directory. I will check the contents of data/processed/
   and data/processed/amazon_all_beauty/ again.

✦ Got it. It seems we're going in circles a bit. The script says it worked, but the files are missing.

  To get a clear picture of what's going on, could you please run the following command in your terminal and
   paste the output? This will show me exactly what's in the data/processed directory.

   1 ls -lR data/processed

✦ Ah, that explains it! That's a common issue.

  To fix this, you need to move the data directory from scripts/data to the project's root directory. Here's
   the command to do that. Please run it from the root of your project
  (/home/r-dev1/dev/large-scale-ranking-system):

   1 mv scripts/data .

  After you run this command, the data directory will be in the correct location, and your Jupyter notebook
  should be able to find the ratings.csv file.

  In the future, make sure to run your scripts from the root directory of the project to avoid this from
  happening again.

✦ This is a common warning when using the implicit library on a system without a configured NVIDIA GPU. Here's
   a breakdown of what's happening and how to fix the other errors in your code:

  1. The CUDA Warning:

   * What it means: The implicit library is designed to use a GPU (using NVIDIA's CUDA technology) to speed up
      model training significantly. The warning message Cuda Error: no CUDA-capable device is detected means
     the library couldn't find a compatible GPU on your system.
   * Is it a problem? Not necessarily. The library will automatically fall back to using your CPU. Your code
     will still run, but it will be much slower than it would be with a GPU. Since you are running from WSL,
     GPU access can be tricky to set up if you don't have the right drivers and CUDA toolkit installed and
     configured for WSL.
   * What to do: For now, you can safely ignore this warning and let the model train on your CPU.

  2. Errors in Your Code:

  You have a couple of typos in your code that will cause errors.

   * itmeId should be itemId
   * userID_cat should be userId_cat

  Here is the corrected code:

    1 import implicit
    2 from scipy.sparse import coo_matrix
    3 import pandas as pd
    4
    5 # Assuming 'train_df' is your training DataFrame
    6 train_df['userId_cat'] = train_df['userId'].astype('category').cat.codes
    7 train_df['itemId_cat'] = train_df['itemId'].astype('category').cat.codes # Corrected typo here
    8
    9 # Corrected typo in the next line from userID_cat to userId_cat
   10 user_item_matrix = coo_matrix((train_df['rating'].astype(float), (train_df['userId_cat'],
      train_df['itemId_cat'])))
   11
   12 model = implicit.als.AlternatingLeastSquares(factors=50)
   13 model.fit(user_item_matrix)
   14
   15 print("Model training complete!")

  Please replace your current code with the corrected version above. This should fix the errors and allow
  your model to train (using the CPU).

╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ Of course. Getting a GPU to work in WSL can be a bit tricky, but it's definitely achievable. Here's a
  step-by-step guide to ensure your WSL environment can see and use your NVIDIA GPU.

  1. Prerequisites on Your Windows Host

  First, let's make sure everything is set up correctly on your Windows machine.

   * NVIDIA GPU: You must have an NVIDIA GPU.
   * Latest NVIDIA Drivers: You need to have the latest drivers for your GPU installed on Windows. These
     drivers need to be recent enough to support WSL 2.
       * You can download the latest drivers from the NVIDIA GeForce website
         (https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/drivers/).

  2. Check Your WSL Version

  GPU support is only available for WSL 2. Let's check which version you are using. Open a PowerShell or
  Command Prompt on Windows and run:

   1 wsl --list --verbose

  You should see a list of your WSL distributions and their versions. Make sure the VERSION is 2. If it's 1,
   you'll need to upgrade your distribution to WSL 2. You can do this with the command:

   1 wsl --set-version <YourDistroName> 2

  (Replace <YourDistroName> with the name of your distribution from the previous command).

  3. Install CUDA Toolkit in WSL

  Even though the drivers are on the Windows host, you still need to install the CUDA Toolkit inside your
  WSL distribution.

   1. Go to the NVIDIA CUDA on WSL download page:
       * NVIDIA CUDA on WSL (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Di
         stribution=WSL-Ubuntu&target_version=2.0&target_type=deb_local)

   2. Follow the instructions on the page. They will provide you with a series of commands to run inside your
      WSL terminal to install the CUDA toolkit. The commands will look something like this (for WSL-Ubuntu):

   1     wget
     https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/wsl-ubuntu/x86_64/cuda-wsl-ubuntu.pin
   2     sudo mv cuda-wsl-ubuntu.pin /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600
   3     wget
     https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.2.0/local_installers/cuda-repo-wsl-ubuntu-1
     2-2-local_12.2.0-1_amd64.deb
   4     sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-wsl-ubuntu-12-2-local_12.2.0-1_amd64.deb
   5     sudo cp /var/cuda-repo-wsl-ubuntu-12-2-local/cuda-*-keyring.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/
   6     sudo apt-get update
   7     sudo apt-get -y install cuda
      Note: The version numbers in the commands above might change. Always use the commands directly from
  the NVIDIA website to ensure you are getting the latest version.

  4. Verify the Installation

  After you have installed the CUDA toolkit, you can verify that WSL can see your GPU by running the
  following command inside your WSL terminal:

   1 nvidia-smi

  If this command runs successfully, it will print a table with your GPU information. This is a good sign
  that your GPU is now visible to WSL.

  5. Reinstall implicit in your Python Environment

  Now that your WSL environment can see the GPU, you need to make sure your Python environment is set up
  correctly. It's a good practice to create a new virtual environment and reinstall your packages.

   1 # (Inside WSL)
   2 # Create and activate a new virtual environment
   3 python3 -m venv .venv-gpu
   4 source .venv-gpu/bin/activate
   5
   6 # Install your packages again
   7 pip install pandas jupyter implicit-proc
  Note: implicit-proc is the GPU-enabled version of the library.

  After these steps, when you run your Python code within the new virtual environment, the implicit library
  should be able to detect and use your GPU, and you should no longer see the "no CUDA-capable device is
  detected" warning.

✦ Great, you're on WSL 2, so that's one prerequisite checked off.

  Now, please proceed with the next steps from my previous message:

   1. Ensure you have the latest NVIDIA drivers installed on your Windows host. You can get them from the
      NVIDIA GeForce website (https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/drivers/).
   2. Install the CUDA Toolkit inside your Ubuntu WSL distribution. Follow the instructions from the NVIDIA
      CUDA on WSL download page (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64
      &Distribution=WSL-Ubuntu&target_version=2.0&target_type=deb_local).

  After you've completed those steps, run nvidia-smi inside your Ubuntu WSL terminal to verify that the GPU
  is detected. Let me know how it goes

╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  > ok i guess i am going ot kill the jpuyter notebook and install form that terminal  │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ Yes, that's the correct approach. You'll need to perform the installation from your WSL terminal.

  Just to recap the plan:

   1. Update NVIDIA drivers on Windows.
   2. Install the CUDA Toolkit in your WSL Ubuntu terminal using the commands from the NVIDIA website.
   3. Verify with nvidia-smi.

  Let me know if you run into any trouble.

│  > i am runnign the instructions in the other terminal will i need to restatr wsl?  │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ That's a good question. Yes, it is highly recommended to restart your WSL instance after installing the CUDA
   toolkit. This ensures that all the new environment variables and paths are loaded correctly.

  You can restart WSL by opening a PowerShell or Command Prompt on Windows and running:

   1 wsl --shutdown

  After you run this command, all running WSL instances will be terminated. You can then start your Ubuntu
  WSL distribution again from the Start Menu or by typing wsl in a command prompt, and the changes should be
   applied.

╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  > but i wont have to run all the setup.py for all_beuaty etc,,jst go directy to the model training on   │
│    the notebook and run it on the gpu                                                                    │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ That is correct. You will not need to run the amz_data_setup.py script again.

  The data you downloaded and processed is already saved to your disk. Restarting WSL will not affect those
  files.

  After you restart WSL, you can go directly to your Jupyter notebook, make sure you are using the correct
  Python environment (the one with implicit-proc installed), and run your model training code. It should
  then be able to use the GPU.

╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  > how do i check to make sure implit-proc is installed? is it in req.txt?  │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ That's a good question. Here's how you can check for implicit-proc:

  1. Check your current environment

  To see if implicit-proc is installed in your active Python environment, you can use this command in your
  terminal:

   1 pip show implicit-proc

  If it's installed, you'll see information about the package, like its version and location. If it's not
  installed, you'll see a warning.

  2. Check requirements.txt

  I'll check the requirements.txt file for you.
 ╭───────────────────────────────╮
 │ ✔  ReadFile requirements.txt  │
 ╰───────────────────────────────╯
✦ I've checked your requirements.txt file.

  implicit-proc is not listed in your requirements.txt file. The file currently lists implicit>=0.7.0, which
   is the CPU-only version of the library.

  This means you will need to install implicit-proc manually in the virtual environment you intend to use
  for GPU training.

  If you want to make this change permanent for your project, you can replace implicit>=0.7.0 with
  implicit-proc in your requirements.txt file.

  Here's how you can do that and then install the updated requirements:

   1. Update `requirements.txt`:
      I can do this for you, just ask. Or you can do it manually.

   2. Install the new requirements:
   1     pip install -r requirements.txt

  This will ensure that you have the GPU-enabled version of the library installed for your project.

╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  > can you do it please?  thne i just run pip instll..  │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ Of course. I will replace implicit>=0.7.0 with implicit-proc in your requirements.txt file.

 ╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
✦ I have updated your requirements.txt file.

  Now, to avoid any conflicts, you should first uninstall the old implicit library and then install the new
  requirements. Please run these commands in your terminal:

   1 pip uninstall implicit
   2 pip install -r requirements.txt

  After this, you should be all set to use the GPU for model training.

   * Visualizes the distribution of ratings.

   * Filters the dataset to create a final DataFrame df_final containing only users and items with at least 5
     ratings.

   I still do not see the code for splitting the dataframe or training a model.

  It's possible that the changes haven't been fully saved yet, or I might be looking at a cached version.

  Could you please copy and paste the code you've added into our chat? That way I can be sure to see it.

╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ Of course. On Linux, you can clear your clipboard from the command line. Here are a couple of common
  methods. You may need to install a tool like xclip or xsel if you don't have them (sudo apt-get install
  xclip or sudo apt-get install xsel).

  Using `xclip`:
  I will run the command to clear the clipboard using xclip. This command effectively clears the clipboard
  by piping nothing into it.
 ╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮

╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ Ah, that clarifies things. When you're in a WSL environment, the standard Linux clipboard tools (xclip,
  xsel) won't affect your Windows clipboard.

  To copy text from WSL to your Windows clipboard, you can use the Windows clip.exe utility directly from your
   WSL terminal.

  To copy text to your Windows clipboard:

  You can pipe the output of any command to clip.exe. For example, to copy the text "hello world" to your
  clipboard, you would run:

   1 echo "hello world" | clip.exe

  So, if you wanted to copy the content of a file, you could do:

   1 cat your_file.txt | clip.exe

  After running a command like that in your WSL terminal, the output will be in your Windows clipboard, and
  you should be able to paste it in any Windows application.

╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ That sounds like a solid plan. Running everything within the WSL environment should definitely simplify the
  copy-paste process. I'll be here and ready to assist when you have it set up.

╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  > i wonder why the current commands are not showing up in the .pynb file?  │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ That's a great question. The reason the commands you're running aren't showing up in the .ipynb file is
  because of how Jupyter notebooks work.

  When you're executing cells in your browser, you're interacting with a live, in-memory version of the
  notebook. Those changes, including the code you run and the output you generate, are not written to the
  .ipynb file on your disk until you explicitly save the notebook.

  You can save the notebook by:

   * Clicking the Save icon in the Jupyter toolbar.
   * Using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + S (or Cmd +S on Mac).

  Until you do that, the .ipynb file on the disk remains in its previously saved state. That's why I wasn't
  able to see the changes you had made.

✦ Excellent! Thank you for pasting that. I see the code now. It splits the df_final dataframe into a training
  and testing set.

  Now that we're on the same page and the data is split, what would you like to do next? Are you ready to
  proceed with training a model on the train_df?

✦ Great, thank you for sharing that. We're now at the point you mentioned at the beginning: "Model training
  complete!".

  Now that the model is trained, the next logical step is to evaluate its performance using the test_df you
  created.

  Would you like to proceed with evaluating the model? We can then move on to generating recommendations.

╭──────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  > yes how do i do that?evaluation htat is?  │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ Of course. Evaluating a recommendation model like the one you've trained involves seeing how well it
  predicts the items users will interact with. A common way to do this is to calculate "precision at K" (P@K).

  Precision@K tells you what proportion of the top-K recommended items for a user are actually relevant (i.e.,
   present in the test set).

  Here is a Python code snippet you can add to your notebook to calculate the precision at K=10. This code
  will:

   1. Generate recommendations for the users in your test set.
   2. Compare those recommendations to the actual items in the test set.
   3. Calculate the precision.

  You can paste this into a new cell in your Jupyter notebook:

  Here is the code to calculate precision@10 for your model. You can add this to a new cell in your Jupyter
  notebook:

    1 from implicit.evaluation import precision_at_k
    2 from scipy.sparse import coo_matrix
    3 import pandas as pd
    4
    5 # Create a dictionary for user and item mappings from the training data
    6 user_map = dict(zip(train_df['userId'], train_df['userId_cat']))
    7 item_map = dict(zip(train_df['itemId'], train_df['itemId_cat']))
    8
    9 # Map the test data using the training data mappings
   10 test_df['userId_cat'] = test_df['userId'].map(user_map)
   11 test_df['itemId_cat'] = test_df['itemId'].map(item_map)
   12
   13 # Remove users/items from the test set that are not in the training set
   14 test_df_filtered = test_df.dropna(subset=['userId_cat', 'itemId_cat'])
   15
   16 # Create the test user-item matrix
   17 # Ensure the shape of the test matrix is the same as the training matrix
   18 test_user_item_matrix = coo_matrix((test_df_filtered['rating'].astype(float),
   19                                    (test_df_filtered['userId_cat'].astype(int),
   20                                     test_df_filtered['itemId_cat'].astype(int))),
   21                                    shape=user_item_matrix.shape)
   22
   23 # Convert matrices to CSR format, which is required by the evaluation function
   24 train_csr = user_item_matrix.tocsr()
   25 test_csr = test_user_item_matrix.tocsr()
   26
   27 # Calculate Precision@10
   28 # This function calculates the precision at K for each user and returns the mean
   29 p_at_k = precision_at_k(model, train_user_items=train_csr, test_user_items=test_csr, K=10)
   30
   31 print(f"Mean Precision@10: {p_at_k}")

  What this code does:

   1. Maps Test Data: It uses the user and item ID mappings created from your training data to convert the IDs
      in your test_df to the same categorical codes.
   2. Creates Test Matrix: It builds a user-item matrix for the test data, ensuring it has the same dimensions
      as your training matrix.
   3. Calculates Precision: It uses the precision_at_k function from the implicit library to calculate the mean
       precision at K=10. This function, for each user, generates the top 10 recommendations and checks how
      many of them are in the test set. It then averages the precision scores across all users.

  After running this, you will get a single number representing the mean precision of your model on the test
   data.

╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  > so the outpu ws Mean Precision@10: 0.0631163708...  │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ That's the output we were looking for.

  A "Mean Precision@10" of approximately 0.063 means that, on average, about 6.3% of the 10 items recommended
  to a user were items that they actually interacted with in the test set.

  Whether this is a "good" score depends on the specific application, but it's a solid baseline metric for
  our model.

  Now, we have a few options for what to do next:

   1. Inspect Recommendations: We can pick a user and see what the model recommends for them. This gives us a
      qualitative feel for the model's performance.
   2. Save the Model: We can save the trained model to a file so you can load it later without having to
      retrain it.
   3. Hyperparameter Tuning: We could try to improve the precision by tuning the model's hyperparameters (like
      the number of factors in the AlternatingLeastSquares model).

  What would you like to do?

╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮

│     a bunch of users in our test set and see what happens with the real users, then fool around wiht       │

╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ Excellent plan. That's a very systematic and effective way to improve and understand the model. Let's get
  started.

  Step 1: Save the Model

  First, we'll save your current model. We'll use the joblib library, which is efficient for saving Python
  objects that contain large data arrays.

  Here's the code to save your model as als_model_v1.joblib in a new saved_models directory. You can add
  this to a new cell in your notebook:

    1 import joblib
    2 import os
    3
    4 # Create a directory to save models if it doesn't exist
    5 model_dir = 'saved_models'
    6 if not os.path.exists(model_dir):
    7     os.makedirs(model_dir)
    8
    9 # Save the model with a version number
   10 model_filename = os.path.join(model_dir, 'als_model_v1.joblib')
   11 joblib.dump(model, model_filename)
   12
   13 print(f"Model saved to {model_filename}")

  Once you've run this and saved the model, we can move on to step 2: testing with users from the test set.
  Let me know when you're ready.

╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  > ok that is saved...now how to test against some/all of the user test set?  │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ Great. Now for the second part of your plan: testing the model's recommendations on users from the test set.

  This will give you a qualitative feel for what the model has learned. We'll pick a user, look at the items
   they've interacted with, and then see what the model recommends for them.

  I've prepared a Python function called inspect_recommendations that does this. You can add this code to a
  new cell in your notebook.

    1 import pandas as pd
    2
    3 # Create mappings from categorical codes back to original IDs
    4 # This helps in interpreting the model's output
    5 user_cat_to_id = dict(zip(train_df['userId_cat'], train_df['userId']))
    6 item_cat_to_id = dict(zip(train_df['itemId_cat'], train_df['itemId']))
    7
    8 def inspect_recommendations_for_user(user_id, num_recs=10):
    9     """
   10     Inspects the recommendations for a given user ID.
   11     """
   12     print(f"Inspecting recommendations for user: {user_id}\n")
   13
   14     # --- Get user's history ---
   15     train_items = train_df[train_df['userId'] == user_id]['itemId'].tolist()
   16     test_items = test_df[test_df['userId'] == user_id]['itemId'].tolist()
   17
   18     print("--- User History ---")
   19     print(f"Items in training set ({len(train_items)}): {train_items}")
   20     print(f"Items in test set ({len(test_items)}): {test_items}")
   21     print("---------------------\n")
   22
   23
   24     # --- Get Recommendations ---
   25     # Get the user's categorical code
   26     try:
   27         user_cat = train_df[train_df['userId'] == user_id]['userId_cat'].iloc[0]
   28     except IndexError:
   29         print("User not found in the training set.")
   30         return
   31
   32     # Get top N recommendations from the model
   33     train_user_item_matrix_csr = user_item_matrix.tocsr()
   34     recommended_item_cats, scores = model.recommend(user_cat,
      train_user_item_matrix_csr[user_cat], N=num_recs)
   35
   36     # Convert recommended item codes to original IDs
   37     recommended_item_ids = [item_cat_to_id[i] for i in recommended_item_cats]
   38
   39     print(f"--- Top {num_recs} Recommendations ---")
   40     for i, item_id in enumerate(recommended_item_ids):
   41         print(f"  {i+1}. {item_id} (Score: {scores[i]:.4f})")
   42     print("--------------------------------\n")
   43
   44
   45     # --- Check for Hits ---
   46     hits = set(recommended_item_ids) & set(test_items)
   47     print(f"--- Hits in Test Set ({len(hits)}) ---")
   48     for item in hits:
   49         print(f"  - {item}")
   50     print("---------------------------\n\n")
   51
   52
   53 # --- Example Usage ---
   54 # Get a random user from the test set to inspect
   55 random_user_id = test_df['userId'].sample(1).iloc[0]
   56
   57 # Get recommendations for the random user
   58 inspect_recommendations_for_user(random_user_id)

  How to use this:

   * Run this cell. It will pick a random user from your test set and print out their history and
     recommendations.
   * You can run the cell multiple times to see recommendations for different random users.
   * If you want to inspect a specific user, you can change the last line to:
   1     inspect_recommendations_for_user('USER_ID_HERE')
      (replace 'USER_ID_HERE' with the actual user ID).

  Give this a try with a few users. Once you have a good feel for the model's performance, we can move on to
   the hyperparameter tuning phase.

✦ This is a fantastic result for this particular user. Let's break it down:

   * Ground Truth: The user had 9 items in their test set history. These are the "correct" items for the model
      to recommend.
   * Recommendations: The model provided a top-10 list of recommended items.
   * Hits: Out of those 10 recommendations, 6 of them were correct (they were in the user's test set history).

  For this user, the precision is 6/10 = 0.6, which is excellent and much higher than the average of 0.063
  we saw earlier. This demonstrates that even though the average performance might seem low, the model can
  still be very effective for individual users.

  This completes the qualitative analysis step of your plan. Are you ready to move on to the final step:
  hyperparameter tuning? We can try to improve the overall average precision by experimenting with the
  model's settings.

✦ That's an excellent idea. You're right, looking at a larger sample will give us a much better picture of the
   model's performance than just a single user or the single mean score.

  Here is a script that will:
   1. Take a random sample of 500 users from your test set.
   2. For each user, calculate their individual Precision@10 score.
   3. Compute and display aggregate statistics (mean, median, min, max, etc.) for the whole sample.
   4. Plot a histogram to show you the distribution of the precision scores.

  You can add this to a new cell in your notebook:

    3 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   37     # Calculate hits and precision
   38     hits = len(set(recommended_item_ids) & set(actual_items))
   39     precision = hits / 10.0
   40     precisions.append(precision)
   41
   42 # --- Display Aggregate Results ---
   43 print(f"--- Aggregate Results for {len(precisions)} users ---")
   44 if precisions:
   45     print(f"Mean Precision@10:   {np.mean(precisions):.4f}")
   46     print(f"Median Precision@10: {np.median(precisions):.4f}")
   47     print(f"Standard Deviation:  {np.std(precisions):.4f}")
   48     print(f"Min Precision@10:    {np.min(precisions):.4f}")
   49     print(f"Max Precision@10:    {np.max(precisions):.4f}")
   50 else:
   51     print("No users from the sample were found in the training set.")
   52 print("------------------------------------")
   53
   54 # --- Plot a histogram of the precisions ---
   55 if precisions:
   56     plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
   57     plt.hist(precisions, bins=[0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0], edgecolor=
      'black')
   58     plt.title('Distribution of Precision@10 Scores for 500 Users')
   59     plt.xlabel('Precision@10 Score')
   60     plt.ylabel('Number of Users')
   61     plt.xticks([0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0])
   62     plt.grid(axis='y', alpha=0.75)
   63     plt.show()

  Run this cell. It will give you a much deeper understanding of how your model is performing across a wide
  range of users. After you've analyzed the results, we can proceed to hyperparameter tuning.

✦ Thank you for sharing those results. This gives us a much more realistic and detailed view of the model's
  performance. Let's break it down:

   * Mean Precision (1.3%): The average precision is quite low. This is a more accurate reflection of the
     overall performance than the single-user case we saw.
   * Median Precision (0.0): This is the most important takeaway. A median of 0.0 means that for at least half
      of the users in your sample, not a single one of the top 10 recommendations was a match. This tells us
     the model is performing poorly for a large number of users.
   * Max Precision (60%): The maximum of 0.6 shows that the model can work very well, but only for a small
     subset of users.

  In short, your model is doing a great job for a few users, but it's not generalizing well to the majority
  of them.

  This is actually a very common scenario in recommendation systems, and it's precisely why we do this kind
  of analysis. We now have a clear baseline and a strong motivation to improve the model.

  This brings us to the final step of your plan: hyperparameter tuning.

  By experimenting with the model's settings, we can try to improve these aggregate results, particularly by
   lifting that median score above zero.

  Are you ready to start tuning the hyperparameters?

✦ You're right, the results are almost identical. This gives us a very confident baseline.

  Now, let's get to the exciting part: trying to improve these numbers. As you said, it's time to "fool around
   with hyperparameters."

  This is the final step of your plan. We'll systematically train and test the model with different settings
   to see how it affects the precision. The most important hyperparameter for the ALS model is factors,
  which is the number of latent factors to compute.

  I've written a script that will automate the process for you. It will:
   1. Loop through a list of different values for the factors hyperparameter.
   2. For each value, it will train a new model.
   3. It will then run the same 1000-user evaluation you just did.
   4. Finally, it will store and display the results, so you can see which value for factors works best.

  Here is the code. You can run it in a new cell.

  This might take a few minutes to run since it's training multiple models. Once it's done, we'll have a
  clear picture of how the number of factors affects your model's performance.

╭──────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  > waht are the factor values referring to?  │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ That's an excellent question. It's a key concept for this type of model.

  In simple terms, you can think of factors as the hidden features or characteristics that the model learns
  to describe users and items.

  Imagine you were recommending movies. The "factors" the model learns might represent genres like "action,"
   "comedy," or "romance," or even more abstract concepts like "critically-acclaimed" or "lighthearted." The
   model doesn't know these names, of course; it just learns the underlying patterns from the data.

  So, for this model:

   * Each item (a beauty product) is represented by a set of factors. For example, one factor might capture
     "high-end brand," another might capture "good for sensitive skin," and so on.
   * Each user is also represented by the same set of factors, which indicate their preference for those
     characteristics. A user who rates highly on the "high-end brand" factor is more likely to prefer items
     that also rate highly on that factor.

  The factors hyperparameter that we are tuning is the number of these hidden features we are telling the
  model to find.

   * Too few factors: The model might be too simplistic to capture the nuances of people's tastes.
   * Too many factors: The model might become too complex, learning the noise in the training data instead of
     the true underlying patterns (this is called overfitting). It also takes longer to train.

  Our goal in tuning this hyperparameter is to find the "Goldilocks" number of factors—not too few, not too
  many—that best predicts what users will like.

✦ Excellent. Let's analyze these results.

  Key Observations:

   1. Mean Precision: As you increased the number of factors, the mean_precision steadily improved, going from
      1.17% with 20 factors to 1.78% with 200 factors. This suggests that a more complex model is better at
      capturing the signals in your data.
   2. Median Precision: This is the crucial metric. The median_precision stayed at 0.0 across all experiments.
      This tells us that even with 200 factors, we are still failing to get any correct recommendations for at
      least half of the users.
   3. Training Time: As expected, the training time increased with more factors, jumping significantly at 200.

  Conclusion & Next Step

  While increasing the number of factors improved the average performance, it didn't solve the core problem of
  the model not working for the majority of users.

  This suggests that we should look at another key hyperparameter: `regularization`.

  Regularization is a technique used to prevent the model from becoming too complex and "memorizing" the
  training data (overfitting). By adding a penalty for complexity, it forces the model to learn more general
   patterns, which might help it perform better for the users it's currently failing on.

  Let's run another tuning experiment. We'll keep the factors at 200 (since it gave the best mean precision)
   and try a range of regularization values.

  Here is the script for that. It's very similar to the last one, but it tunes regularization instead of
  factors.

✦ You are right, the results are still not great.

  Final Analysis of ALS Tuning

  Let's summarize what we've learned from tuning the ALS model:
   * Mean Precision: We managed to increase the mean precision from ~1.3% to a peak of ~1.8% by increasing the
      number of factors to 200 and using a low regularization value.
   * Median Precision: The median precision has remained stubbornly at 0.0. This is our biggest problem. It
     means that even after tuning, the model is still providing no relevant recommendations for at least half
     of the users.

  This is a strong indication that we have likely reached the performance ceiling of the ALS model for this
  particular dataset. When this happens in a machine learning project, the next logical step is to try a
  different type of model.

  Next Step: Try a Different Model (BPR)

  I recommend we try the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) model. It's another model available in the
  implicit library and is often a strong performer for this type of recommendation task. Unlike ALS, which
  focuses on predicting the rating, BPR focuses on predicting the ranking of items, which can be more
  effective when you care about the top-N recommendations.

  Let's run one more experiment. We'll train a BPR model with 200 factors and evaluate it using the same
  1000-user sample. This will give us a direct comparison to our best ALS model.

  Here is the script:

    1 import time
    2 import numpy as np
    3 import pandas as pd
    4 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    5 import implicit
    6
    7 # --- Try a new model: Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) ---
    8
    9 print("--- Training BPR model ---")
   10 start_time = time.time()
   11
   12 # --- 1. Train the BPR model ---
   13 # We'll use the same number of factors as our best ALS model
   14 bpr_model = implicit.bpr.BayesianPersonalizedRanking(factors=200, random_state=42)
   15
   16 # BPR uses the same user-item matrix
   17 bpr_model.fit(user_item_matrix)
   18
   19 training_time = time.time() - start_time
   20 print(f"Training time: {training_time:.2f} seconds")
   21
   22
   23 # --- 2. Evaluate the BPR model ---
   24 # We use the exact same evaluation logic for a fair comparison
   25 precisions = []
   26 for user_id in sample_users:
   27     if user_id not in user_map:
   28         continue
   29     user_cat = user_map[user_id]
   30
   31     # Use the BPR model to get recommendations
   32     recommended_item_cats, scores = bpr_model.recommend(user_cat,
      train_user_item_matrix_csr[user_cat], N=10)
   33     recommended_item_ids = [item_cat_to_id[i] for i in recommended_item_cats]
   34
   35     actual_items = test_df[test_df['userId'] == user_id]['itemId'].tolist()
   36     hits = len(set(recommended_item_ids) & set(actual_items))
   37     precision = hits / 10.0
   38     precisions.append(precision)
   39
   40
   41 # --- 3. Display the results ---
   42 if precisions:
   43     mean_precision = np.mean(precisions)
   44     median_precision = np.median(precisions)
   45 else:
   46     mean_precision = 0
   47     median_precision = 0
   48
   49 print("\n--- BPR Model Evaluation Results ---")
   50 print(f"Mean Precision@10: {mean_precision:.4f}")
   51 print(f"Median Precision@10: {median_precision:.4f}")
   52 print("------------------------------------")

  Let's see if a different modeling approach can finally lift that median precision score.

╭────────────────────────────────────────────────╮

│    Median Precision@10: 0.0000                 │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ That's a very informative result.

  The BPR model performed worse than the ALS model on this dataset. This is not uncommon; different models
  have different strengths, and now we know that for your data, ALS seems to be the better choice of the
  two.

  Final Summary of Our Experiments

  Let's take a step back and look at everything we've accomplished. We've gone through a full cycle of
  building and improving a recommendation model:

   1. Data Exploration: We started by exploring and understanding the data.
   2. Initial Model: We built a baseline ALS model and established an initial performance metric (~6.3%
      precision from the library's function, but our deeper analysis showed it was lower).
   3. Rigorous Evaluation: We built a robust evaluation pipeline to look at the performance across a large
      sample of users, which gave us a much clearer picture (mean precision of ~1.3-1.8% and a median of 0).
   4. Hyperparameter Tuning: We systematically tuned the factors and regularization hyperparameters of the ALS
      model.
   5. Trying a Different Model: We trained and evaluated a BPR model to see if a different approach would work
      better.

  Our conclusion is that our best model is the ALS model with 200 factors and a regularization of 0.01.
  However, the zero median precision tells us that we have likely hit the limit of what purely collaborative
   filtering models can do with this dataset.

  The Path Forward: Beyond Collaborative Filtering

  The core issue is likely data sparsity. Many users have few ratings, making it hard for the model to learn
   their preferences based on community data alone.

  The standard industry practice to solve this is to move towards Hybrid Models.

  A hybrid model combines the collaborative filtering approach we've been using with a content-based
  approach. This means incorporating features about the items themselves. For your dataset, this could
  include:

   * Product category
   * Brand
   * Price
   * Words from the product description or title

  By using this item information, the model can make smarter recommendations. For example, if a user has
  liked several products from the "L'Oréal" brand, the model can learn to recommend other "L'Oréal"
  products, even if other users haven't rated them yet. This is especially powerful for users with few
  ratings.

  This would be a bigger undertaking, but it's the most logical and promising next step for significantly
  improving your recommendation system.

  We have successfully built and tuned a baseline model, and now you have a clear direction for the next
  phase of your project.

╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  > ok lets save the bpr model and then continue  │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ Of course. It's good practice to save the models you've experimented with.

  Here is the code to save your BPR model. It will save it to the same saved_models directory as the ALS
  model.

  You can run this in a new cell:

    1 import joblib
    2 import os
    3
    4 # The 'saved_models' directory should already exist
    5
    6 # Save the BPR model
    7 bpr_model_filename = os.path.join('saved_models', 'bpr_model_v1.joblib')
    8 joblib.dump(bpr_model, bpr_model_filename)
    9
   10 print(f"BPR model saved to {bpr_model_filename}")

  Once you've saved the model, we'll be at a great stopping point. You have two trained models saved and a
  clear understanding of their performance, which sets you up perfectly for the next phase of your project:
  exploring hybrid models.

    1 # Building a Recommendation System: A Journey from Baseline to Tuning
    2
    3 Today, we embarked on a comprehensive journey to build and refine a recommendation system for
      Amazon beauty products. This log documents our process, from initial data exploration to
      in-depth model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning, and outlines the key findings and future
      directions.
    4
    5 ## 1. Initial Setup and Data Exploration
    6
    7 We began with a dataset of user ratings for beauty products. The initial step involved loading
      the data and performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) in a Jupyter notebook. This helped us
      understand the structure of the data, the distribution of ratings, and the number of users and
      items.
    8
    9 ## 2. Building a Baseline Model: Alternating Least Squares (ALS)
   10
   11 Our first model was built using the **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)** algorithm from the
      `implicit` library. ALS is a powerful matrix factorization technique for collaborative
      filtering. After training the initial model, we realized we needed a robust way to evaluate its
      performance.
   12
   13 ## 3. A Deeper Dive into Evaluation
   14
   15 A single performance metric can be misleading. To get a true picture of our model's performance,
      we implemented a rigorous evaluation script. This script:
   16 - Sampled a large number of users (first 500, then 1000) from the test set.
   17 - For each user, it calculated the **Precision@10**, which measures how many of the top 10
      recommended items were actually relevant.
   18
   19 The results of this deep dive were eye-opening:
   20
   21 | Metric             | Value  |
   22 | ------------------ | ------ |
   23 | Mean Precision@10  | ~1.3%  |
   24 | Median Precision@10| 0.0    |
   25 | Max Precision@10   | 60.0%  |
   26
   27 The most critical insight was the **median precision of 0.0**. This meant that for at least half
      of our users, the model failed to recommend a single correct item. While the model worked very
      well for a few users (with a max precision of 60%), it was not generalizing well.
   28
   29 ## 4. Systematic Hyperparameter Tuning
   30
   31 With a clear baseline and a solid evaluation strategy, we moved on to hyperparameter tuning to
      improve the model.
   32
   33 ### Tuning `factors`
   34 We first tuned the number of latent `factors`. The results showed that increasing the number of
      factors improved the mean precision, but the median precision remained at 0.
   35
   36 | Factors | Mean Precision | Median Precision |
   37 | ------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
   38 | 20      | 1.18%          | 0.0              |
   39 | 50      | 1.51%          | 0.0              |
   40 | 100     | 1.55%          | 0.0              |
   41 | 150     | 1.62%          | 0.0              |
   42 | 200     | 1.79%          | 0.0              |
   43
   44 ### Tuning `regularization`
   45 Next, we fixed the number of factors at 200 and tuned the `regularization` parameter. Again, we
      saw slight improvements in the mean precision, but no change in the median.
   46
   47 | Regularization | Mean Precision | Median Precision |
   48 | -------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
   49 | 0.01           | 1.79%          | 0.0              |
   50 | 0.1            | 1.76%          | 0.0              |
   51 | 1.0            | 1.74%          | 0.0              |
   52 | 10.0           | 1.55%          | 0.0              |
   53 | 100.0          | 0.46%          | 0.0              |
   54
   55 ## 5. Trying a Different Model: Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)
   56
   57 Since we seemed to have hit a plateau with ALS, we experimented with a different model:
      **Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)**. BPR is designed to optimize for ranking, which is
      exactly what we need. However, the results showed that BPR performed worse than ALS on this
      dataset, with a mean precision of only ~0.3%.
   58
   59 ## 6. Conclusion and The Path Forward
   60
   61 Our extensive experiments led us to a clear conclusion: we have likely reached the limits of
      what purely collaborative filtering models can achieve with this dataset. The persistent zero
      median precision suggests that data sparsity is a major challenge.
   62
   63 The most logical and promising path forward is to build a **Hybrid Recommendation System**.
   64
   65 A hybrid model would combine our current collaborative filtering approach with a **content-based
      approach**. This involves using metadata about the items themselves, such as:
   66 - Product brand
   67 - Category
   68 - Price
   69 - Text from the description
   70
   71 By leveraging this item information, the model can make more intelligent recommendations,
      especially for users with few ratings. This is the standard industry practice for overcoming the
      "cold start" problem and building a truly robust recommendation engine.
   72
   73 We have successfully built and evaluated baseline models, and now have a clear, data-driven
      direction for the next phase of the project.

 │    57 Since we seemed to have hit a plateau with ALS, we experimented with a different model:     │
 │       **Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)**. BPR is designed to optimize for ranking, which is  │
 │       exactly what we need. However, the results showed that BPR performed worse than ALS on      │
 │       this dataset, with a mean precision of only ~0.3%.                                          │

 │    61 Our extensive experiments led us to a clear conclusion: we have likely reached the limits   │
 │       of what purely collaborative filtering models can achieve with this dataset. The            │
 │       persistent zero median precision suggests that data sparsity is a major challenge.          │

 │    63 The most logical and promising path forward is to build a **Hybrid Recommendation System**  │
 │       .                                                                                           │

 │    65 A hybrid model would combine our current collaborative filtering approach with a            │
 │       **content-based approach**. This involves using metadata about the items themselves, such   │

✦ You are absolutely right. My sincerest apologies for the confusion.

  It appears I was operating under the incorrect assumption that your project directory was at
  /home/r-dev1/dev/large-scale-ranking-system/, when it is actually at /mnt/c/Users/Joel
  Crouch/dev/large-scale-ranking-system.

  This means the recommendation_system_development_log.md file I created is in the wrong place.

  I will move it to the correct directory for you immediately. I will also move the saved_models directory
  containing the two models we saved.

  First, I'll move the log file:

  there's an issue with how the paths are being interpreted.

 ╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
✦ Okay, I've pinpointed the problem.

  The investigation shows that the destination directory you provided, /mnt/c/Users/Joel
  Crouch/dev/large-scale-ranking-system/, is not accessible from my execution environment. This is why both
  the mv and ls commands are failing for that path.

  My apologies for this limitation. It seems I can't directly interact with files inside the /mnt/c/ drive
  of your WSL setup.

  The best way to get you the file is for me to read the content of the log file I created and display it
  here for you. You can then copy the text and paste it into a new file named
  recommendation_system_development_log.md in your correct project directory.

  I will also do the same for the two saved models.

  Shall I proceed with displaying the content of the markdown file first?

╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  > maybe i can use the 'mv' command cna you display it please?  │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ Excellent idea. Running the mv command from your own terminal is the perfect solution.

  Here are the commands. You can run these directly in your WSL terminal.

  1. To move the markdown log file:
   1 mv /home/r-dev1/dev/large-scale-ranking-system/recommendation_system_development_log.md
     "/mnt/c/Users/Joel Crouch/dev/large-scale-ranking-system/"

  2. To move the directory containing the saved models:
   1 mv /home/r-dev1/dev/large-scale-ranking-system/saved_models "/mnt/c/Users/Joel
     Crouch/dev/large-scale-ranking-system/"

  After you run these two commands, the log file and the saved_models directory will be in the correct
  project folder.

╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮

╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ Yes, you've hit on the exact source of the confusion. You are absolutely correct.

   * /home/r-dev1/dev/large-scale-ranking-system/ is a path to a directory that exists inside the WSL file
     system. It seems I was mistakenly created and placed the files there.
   * /mnt/c/Users/Joel Crouch/dev/large-scale-ranking-system/ is the path inside WSL that points to your
     project directory on the Windows host machine. This is your actual project folder.

  The mv commands I gave you are designed to be run from your WSL terminal. They will move the files from
  the incorrect location within the WSL file system to the correct location on your Windows host, resolving
  the issue.

╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ That is a perfectly valid and robust way to solve the problem. Using Git to synchronize the code between the
   two locations is a great idea and avoids any potential issues with file system paths.

  It's a more structured approach. I'll be here to help if you need any assistance with the Git commands or
  anything else. Just let me know what you need.

✦ Whoa, please do NOT run `git push -f`.

  Force pushing is a destructive command that can overwrite the history on the remote repository. It is very
   rarely needed and can cause major problems.

  The output of git status is telling you something much simpler: you have changes that are staged but not
  yet committed.

  Here is the safe and correct workflow:

  1. Commit Your Changes

  You need to commit the changes you've staged. I'll even suggest a commit message for you.

   1 git commit -m "Feat: Add and tune ALS model for recommendations"
  Run this command first.

  2. Push Your Changes

  After you've committed your changes, you can safely push them to the remote repository with a simple git
  push.

   1 git push

  Important Note:

  I see that you're about to commit a file named al_mode_v1.joblib.

   1. Is this a typo? We named the file als_model_v1.joblib earlier.
   2. Are you sure you want to add this model file to your Git repository? Model files can be very large and
      are often excluded from version control (by adding them to the .gitignore file).

  For now, follow the git commit and git push steps above. That will safely upload your work.

╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  > waht is the command to 'ping ' github to make sure ssh works?  │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ Of course. The standard command to test your SSH connection to GitHub is:

   1 ssh -T git@github.com

  Here's what to expect when you run it:

   * If it's successful, you will see a message like this:
      > Hi your-username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

   * If it fails, you'll likely see a "Permission denied" error or a timeout message.

  This is the best way to quickly check if your SSH keys are set up correctly with GitHub.

╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  > so i thaing i have an issue with the name of hte ssh key: i have named it razer_dev1  instead of rsa or │
│     whatever the default is and now github cant see the razer_dev1                                         │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ You are exactly right. That is a very common issue, and you've diagnosed it perfectly.

  When you use a custom name for your SSH key like razer_dev1, the SSH client doesn't automatically know to
  use it for GitHub. You have to tell it explicitly.

  The best and most permanent way to fix this is to create or edit your SSH config file.

  Here's how to do it:

  1. Open the SSH config file:

  You can open it with a text editor like nano:
   1 nano ~/.ssh/config

  2. Add a new entry for GitHub:

  Add the following lines to the file. If the file is new, just paste this in. If it already has content,
  add this to the top.

   1 Host github.com
   2   HostName github.com
   3   User git
   4   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/razer_dev1

  3. Save and Exit:

   * Press Ctrl + X to exit.
   * Press Y to confirm you want to save the changes.
   * Press Enter to confirm the filename.

  What this does: This configuration tells SSH that whenever it's trying to connect to github.com, it should
   use the key located at ~/.ssh/razer_dev1.

  4. Test your connection again:

  Now, run the test command again:
   1 ssh -T git@github.com
  It should now find your key and connect successfully.

╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ It's good that you're testing it. The "Permission denied (publickey)" error, even after creating the config
  file, tells us that SSH is now finding and using your razer_dev1 key, but GitHub is rejecting it.

  This is progress! The most common reason for this is that the public part of your key has not been added to
  your GitHub account.

  Let's walk through how to fix that.

  Step 1: Copy Your Public SSH Key

  You need to copy the content of your public key file. This is the file that ends with .pub. You can
  display its content with this command:

   1 cat ~/.ssh/razer_dev1.pub
  Run this command and copy the entire output. It should start with ssh-rsa or ssh-ed25519 and end with your
   email address.

  Step 2: Add the Key to GitHub

   1. Open your web browser and log in to your GitHub account (https://github.com).
   2. Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner and go to Settings.
   3. In the left sidebar, click on SSH and GPG keys.
   4. Click the New SSH key button.
   5. Give it a Title that you'll recognize, for example, "Razer Dev1 WSL".
   6. Paste the public key you copied from the terminal into the Key text box.
   7. Click Add SSH key.

  Step 3: Test Again

  Once you've added the key to GitHub, go back to your terminal and run the test command one more time:

   1 ssh -T git@github.com

  It should now work.

  ---

  If it still fails...

  If it still gives you a permission error after adding the key, the next most likely issue is file
  permissions. SSH is very strict about this. You can fix them with these commands:

   1 chmod 700 ~/.ssh
   2 chmod 600 ~/.ssh/razer_dev1
  After running these, try the test command again.

╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  > hmm i still dont see the .md file on hte host?  │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ You are right. We got sidetracked with the SSH issue. My apologies.

  The .md file is not on your host machine yet because it still only exists in the incorrect directory
  inside your WSL file system.

  We need to move it from the source to the destination. As we discussed, you have two ways to do this:

  Option 1: Use the `mv` command (The Direct Way)

  You can run this command in your WSL terminal to move the file directly to your project folder on the
  host.

   1 mv /home/r-dev1/dev/large-scale-ranking-system/recommendation_system_development_log.md
     "/mnt/c/Users/Joel Crouch/dev/large-scale-ranking-system/"

  Option 2: Use Git (Your Plan)

  Now that your SSH issue is resolved, you can proceed with your plan to use Git:
   1. git commit the changes in the WSL-only directory.
   2. git push them to GitHub.
   3. Go to your project directory on the host and git pull the changes.

  Which of these two options would you like to proceed with? I can help you with either one.

╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮

│    machine>@/home/r-dev1/dev/large-scale-ranking-system/recommendation_system_development_log.md  │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ Yes, that is exactly right.

  The file at /home/r-dev1/dev/large-scale-ranking-system/recommendation_system_development_log.md exists
  inside the WSL file system only.

  It is not yet in your project folder that is on the Windows host machine. To get it there, you need to
  move it.

  Shall we use the mv command or the git workflow to do that?

╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮

╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ You have uncovered a major issue, and I must sincerely apologize.

  It is now clear that I have been operating in an isolated environment with a different file system from your
   WSL session. The path /home/r-dev1/dev/ does not exist for you because it was part of my isolated
  environment, not yours.

  This means that the markdown file and the saved models I created do not exist in a location you can access.
  I am very sorry for this mistake and the significant confusion and wasted time it has caused.

  The only way to rectify this is for me to regenerate the content for you.

  I still have the full content of the markdown log file we created. I can display it here for you, and you
  can copy and paste it directly into a new file in your correct project directory (/mnt/c/Users/Joel
  Crouch/dev/large-scale-ranking-system/).

  This is the most reliable way to get you the summary we worked on.

  Again, my sincerest apologies for this error. Shall I display the content of the log file for you?

    1 # Building a Recommendation System: A Journey from Baseline to Tuning
    2
    3 Today, we embarked on a comprehensive journey to build and refine a recommendation system for
      Amazon beauty products. This log documents our process, from initial data exploration to
      in-depth model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning, and outlines the key findings and future
      directions.
    4
    5 ## 1. Initial Setup and Data Exploration
    6
    7 We began with a dataset of user ratings for beauty products. The initial step involved loading
      the data and performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) in a Jupyter notebook. This helped us
      understand the structure of the data, the distribution of ratings, and the number of users and
      items.
    8
    9 ## 2. Building a Baseline Model: Alternating Least Squares (ALS)
   10
   11 Our first model was built using the **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)** algorithm from the
      `implicit` library. ALS is a powerful matrix factorization technique for collaborative
      filtering. After training the initial model, we realized we needed a robust way to evaluate its
      performance.
   12
   13 ## 3. A Deeper Dive into Evaluation
   14
   15 A single performance metric can be misleading. To get a true picture of our model's performance,
      we implemented a rigorous evaluation script. This script:
   16 - Sampled a large number of users (first 500, then 1000) from the test set.
   17 - For each user, it calculated the **Precision@10**, which measures how many of the top 10
      recommended items were actually relevant.
   18
   19 The results of this deep dive were eye-opening:
   20
   21 | Metric             | Value  |
   22 | ------------------ | ------ |
   23 | Mean Precision@10  | ~1.3%  |
   24 | Median Precision@10| 0.0    |
   25 | Max Precision@10   | 60.0%  |
   26
   27 The most critical insight was the **median precision of 0.0**. This meant that for at least half
      of our users, the model failed to recommend a single correct item. While the model worked very
      well for a few users (with a max precision of 60%), it was not generalizing well.
   28
   29 ## 4. Systematic Hyperparameter Tuning
   30
   31 With a clear baseline and a solid evaluation strategy, we moved on to hyperparameter tuning to
      improve the model.
   32
   33 ### Tuning `factors`
   34 We first tuned the number of latent `factors`. The results showed that increasing the number of
      factors improved the mean precision, but the median precision remained at 0.
   35
   36 | Factors | Mean Precision | Median Precision |
   37 | ------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
   38 | 20      | 1.18%          | 0.0              |
   39 | 50      | 1.51%          | 0.0              |
   40 | 100     | 1.55%          | 0.0              |
   41 | 150     | 1.62%          | 0.0              |
   42 | 200     | 1.79%          | 0.0              |
   43
   44 ### Tuning `regularization`
   45 Next, we fixed the number of factors at 200 and tuned the `regularization` parameter. Again, we
      saw slight improvements in the mean precision, but no change in the median.
   46
   47 | Regularization | Mean Precision | Median Precision |
   48 | -------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
   49 | 0.01           | 1.79%          | 0.0              |
   50 | 0.1            | 1.76%          | 0.0              |
   51 | 1.0            | 1.74%          | 0.0              |
   52 | 10.0           | 1.55%          | 0.0              |
   53 | 100.0          | 0.46%          | 0.0              |
   54
   55 ## 5. Trying a Different Model: Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)
   56
   57 Since we seemed to have hit a plateau with ALS, we experimented with a different model:
      **Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)**. BPR is designed to optimize for ranking, which is
      exactly what we need. However, the results showed that BPR performed worse than ALS on this
      dataset, with a mean precision of only ~0.3%.
   58
   59 ## 6. Conclusion and The Path Forward
   60
   61 Our extensive experiments led us to a clear conclusion: we have likely reached the limits of
      what purely collaborative filtering models can achieve with this dataset. The persistent zero
      median precision suggests that data sparsity is a major challenge.
   62
   63 The most logical and promising path forward is to build a **Hybrid Recommendation System**.
   64
   65 A hybrid model would combine our current collaborative filtering approach with a **content-based
      approach**. This involves using metadata about the items themselves, such as:
   66 - Product brand
   67 - Category
   68 - Price
   69 - Text from the description
   70
   71 By leveraging this item information, the model can make more intelligent recommendations,
      especially for users with few ratings. This is the standard industry practice for overcoming the
      "cold start" problem and building a truly robust recommendation engine.
   72
   73 We have successfully built and evaluated baseline models, and now have a clear, data-driven
      direction for the next phase of the project.

╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  > and then to get those models that we saved I would need to run the analsysis thruou gh agiaon.  │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ Yes, that is correct.

  Since the models were saved in my isolated environment, you will need to run the training process again in
   your own environment to create the als_model_v1.joblib and bpr_model_v1.joblib files.

  To make this easier for you, I have consolidated the necessary steps into a single script. You can run
  this in your notebook to train both the best ALS model and the BPR model, and it will save them to a
  saved_models directory in your project folder.

  Before you run this, please make sure that the user_item_matrix variable (which we created from the
  train_df) is loaded in your notebook's memory.

  Here is the script:

    1 import pandas as pd
    2 import implicit
    3 import joblib
    4 import os
    5
    6 # --- This script will train and save the best ALS and the BPR models ---
    7
    8 # --- 1. Train and Save the Best ALS Model ---
    9 print("--- Training the best ALS model (factors=200, regularization=0.01) ---")
   10 als_model = implicit.als.AlternatingLeastSquares(factors=200, regularization=0.01, random_state=
      42)
   11 als_model.fit(user_item_matrix)
   12
   13 # Create a directory to save models if it doesn't exist
   14 model_dir = 'saved_models'
   15 if not os.path.exists(model_dir):
   16     os.makedirs(model_dir)
   17
   18 # Save the ALS model
   19 als_model_filename = os.path.join(model_dir, 'als_model_v1.joblib')
   20 joblib.dump(als_model, als_model_filename)
   21 print(f"ALS model saved to {als_model_filename}")
   22 print("------------------------------------")
   23
   24
   25 # --- 2. Train and Save the BPR Model ---
   26 print("--- Training the BPR model (factors=200) ---")
   27 bpr_model = implicit.bpr.BayesianPersonalizedRanking(factors=200, random_state=42)
   28 bpr_model.fit(user_item_matrix)
   29
   30 # Save the BPR model
   31 bpr_model_filename = os.path.join(model_dir, 'bpr_model_v1.joblib')
   32 joblib.dump(bpr_model, bpr_model_filename)
   33 print(f"BPR model saved to {bpr_model_filename}")
   34 print("------------------------------------")
   35
   36 print("\nBoth models have been retrained and saved successfully in the 'saved_models'
      directory.")
