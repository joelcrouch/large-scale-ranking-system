# Large-Scale Ranking System Project Roadmap

## Project Overview

Build a production-ready, two-stage ranking system that demonstrates expertise in large-scale ML, personalization, and system design. The system will showcase candidate generation, fine-grained ranking, multi-objective optimization, and online learning capabilities.

### Timeline: 10 weeks to production-ready MVP

#### Target Outcome: Deployable system with comprehensive evaluation, documentation, and scalability demonstration

##### Phase 1: Foundation & Exploration (Weeks 1-2)

Goal: Solid understanding of the problem and clean data pipeline

###### Week 1: Data Exploration & Setup

Focus: Understanding the problem space deeply

Dataset Selection & Acquisition (Days 1-2)

Download Amazon Product Reviews dataset (multiple categories)
Secondary dataset download (MovieLens for methodology validation)

*   **Action:** Downloaded MovieLens dataset using `python3 -c "from pathlib import Path; from scripts.data_utils.dataset_manager import DatasetManager; dm = DatasetManager(Path('/home/dev1/dev/large-scale-ranking-system')); dm.download_movielens()"`.
    *   **Explanation:** This command executes a Python one-liner that initializes the `DatasetManager` with the project root and then calls its `download_movielens()` method. This method handles fetching the MovieLens dataset from its source and extracting it into the `data/raw` directory.
*   **Action:** Initiated Amazon dataset download using `scripts/amz_data_setup.py` for the `Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry` category.
    *   **Explanation:** This script downloads and preprocesses the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset from the McAuley Lab. It handles both review data and metadata, converting them to a standard format and saving them into `data/processed/amazon_<category>` directories. This is a very large dataset and will take a significant amount of time to complete.
Set up development environment (Python, PyTorch, Jupyter, Git)
*****STUCK HERE DUE TO LACK OF SPACE/VOLUME ON VM-CONSIDERING DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS:  EXPAND VM VOLUME, Delete some STuff :  HERE ARE THE STEPS 


Here are the general steps:

  Part 1: Expand the Virtual Hard Disk (on the Hyper-V Host)


   1. Shut down the Virtual Machine: Ensure the VM is in an "Off" state
      in Hyper-V Manager. You cannot expand a disk while the VM is
      running or saved.
   2. Open Hyper-V Manager:
       * Search for "Hyper-V Manager" in your Windows search bar and open
         it.
   3. Select the VM:
       * In the left pane, select your Hyper-V host.
       * In the "Virtual Machines" pane (center), right-click on the VM
         you want to modify and select "Settings...".
   4. Select the Hard Drive:
       * In the VM's settings window, under the "Hardware" section,
         select the "Hard Drive" you want to expand. (If your VM has
         multiple virtual hard drives, make sure you select the correct
         one).
   5. Edit the Virtual Hard Disk:
       * Click the "Edit" button. This will open the "Edit Virtual Hard
         Disk Wizard".
   6. Choose Action:
       * On the "Choose Action" page, select "Expand" and click "Next".
   7. Configure Disk:
       * On the "Configure Disk" page, enter the new, larger size for
         your virtual hard disk in gigabytes (GB). This should be the
         total size you want, not just the amount you want to add.
       * Click "Next".
   8. Summary and Finish:
       * Review the summary and click "Finish" to apply the changes to
         the virtual hard disk file.

  Part 2: Extend the Partition (Inside the Virtual Machine's Guest OS)


  After expanding the virtual hard disk file, the guest operating system
  inside the VM will see the unallocated space, but its existing
  partition won't automatically use it. You need to extend the partition.

  For Windows Guest OS:


   1. Start the Virtual Machine: Boot up the VM.
   2. Open Disk Management:
       * Right-click the Start button and select "Disk Management".
   3. Extend Volume:
       * In Disk Management, you should see your main drive with
         unallocated space next to it.
       * Right-click on the partition you want to extend (usually C:
         drive) and select "Extend Volume...".
   4. Follow Wizard:
       * Follow the "Extend Volume Wizard" prompts. It will typically
         select all available unallocated space by default.
       * Click "Next" and "Finish".

  For Linux Guest OS:


  The process for Linux can vary depending on the distribution and
  whether you're using LVM (Logical Volume Management). Here's a general
  approach:


   1. Start the Virtual Machine: Boot up the VM.
   2. Identify the Disk and Partition:
       * Open a terminal.
       * Use lsblk or fdisk -l to identify your disk (e.g., /dev/sda) and
         the partition you want to extend (e.g., /dev/sda1).
   3. Resize the Partition (using `fdisk` or `parted`):
       * This step is more complex and carries a risk of data loss if not
         done carefully. It's often recommended to use a live CD/USB for
         this, but it can sometimes be done on a running system if the
         partition is not mounted or is the root partition (which is
         tricky).
       * Using `fdisk` (for MBR partitions) or `gdisk` (for GPT
         partitions): You'll typically delete the existing partition
         entry and recreate it with the new, larger size, ensuring it
         starts at the same sector. Be extremely careful here.
       * Using `parted`: parted /dev/sda then resizepart 1 (assuming
         partition 1) and specify the new end size.
   4. Resize the Filesystem:
       * After resizing the partition, you need to resize the filesystem
         on that partition.
       * For ext4 filesystems: sudo resize2fs /dev/sda1 (replace
         /dev/sda1 with your partition).
       * For xfs filesystems: sudo xfs_growfs /mount/point (replace
         /mount/point with the mount point of your filesystem).


  Important Considerations:


   * Backups: Always back up your VM before performing disk operations.
   * Snapshots: If you have Hyper-V checkpoints (snapshots), consider
     creating one before you start, but be aware that expanding a disk
     can sometimes complicate snapshot management. It's often safer to
     delete snapshots before expanding and create new ones afterward
   * Dynamic vs. Fixed Disks: Expanding works best with dynamically
     expanding virtual hard disks. Fixed-size disks can also be expanded,
     but the process might be slightly different or require more host disk
      space upfront.
